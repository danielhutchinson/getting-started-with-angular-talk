#### Building all this stuff!

Easy...

- TypeScript Compiler
- Zone.js
- System.js
- ES6 shims and Polyfills
- Karma
- Webpack 
- Gulp / Grunt / Broccoli
- Lots of weird front-end magic hackery, lost sleep, strained relationships...

Notes:
zone js is an execution context that allows you to have pretty stack traces 

finally have webpack build working but your girlfriend has left you and Elliot just read on FrontEndDev Weekly that ELK JS is out and now webpack is deprecated
