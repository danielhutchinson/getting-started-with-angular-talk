#### or just use Angular CLI

[https://cli.angular.io/](https://cli.angular.io/)

```terminal
npm install -g @angular/cli
ng new mikefest-app
cd mikefest-app
ng serve
```

notes:
Angular CLI creates and bootstraps your application for you, compiles all your code, provides you with a webserver and makes your life a lot easier

allows you to just focus on working on your application instead of messing around with build logic
