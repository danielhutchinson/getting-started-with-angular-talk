#### What Angular isnt...

It's not this... This is AngularJS, or Angular 1.x.

Notes:
It isnt AngularJS, Angular and Angular are completely different, they might as well be different frameworks entirely.

Sometimes you'll hear AngularJS referred to as Angular 1.5 and Angular referred to as Angular 2
