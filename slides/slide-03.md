#### What is Angular, really?

- A Front-End Framework
- Based on MVVM architecture
- Uses TypeScript (ideally)
- Component based for simplicity (sometimes)
- Ideal for the creation of Scalable Applications
- Uses ReactiveX throughout (rxjs)

Notes:
TypeScript is recommended (it's the language that the framework itself is built upon) but not required. You can use JavaScript also if you really want to

Angular applications are built up using components, everything else in the framework exists to support these components

Everything put together makes Angular ideal for the cretion of large, scalable applications

Uses RXJS or more specifically, the JavaScript flavour of ReactiveX throughout.
